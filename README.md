Student reminders is a python script made to help studnes remmeber school related tasks by sending them email with reminders. 


The script uses JSON or predefined data and generates personalized study reminders for each student based on their course and preferred time.
It then simulates sending these reminders and logs every key event—generation, scheduling, and delivery—to a log file.
Finally, the scheduler automates daily reminder delivery according to each student’s specified time.
